# H3_decoding
# Overview
This project focuses on modeling the inheritance and distribution of H3 histone variants (H3.1 and H3.3) in genomic regions. The workflow involves data preprocessing, probabilistic modeling, and computational analysis to infer patterns of histone inheritance across generations.
